# Repository structure
This repository contains: 

Data 
•	Line-List 2000-2024: Contains epidemiological variables by age, region, and sex, used primarily for delay analyses.
•	Dengue Cases: Includes reported cases disaggregated into nine age groups, sex, region, and district. This dataset was used to estimate constant-in-time transmission metrics and for logistic regression analyses. It also includes data on deaths and hospitalizations.
•	PopRegion 2000-2024: Provides regional-level population data disaggregated by age group, sex, and year. This dataset was used to compute constant-in-time estimates, incidence rates, and logistic regression models.
•	PopDistrict 2000-2024: Provides district-level population data disaggregated by age group, sex, and year. This dataset was used to compute constant-in-time estimates, incidence rates, and logistic regression models.


StanCode
•	Code to estimate dengue force of infection from age-specific reported case data by Region and district-level.
